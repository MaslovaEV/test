# In Markdown

* You can use Markdown and reStructuredText in the same <Sphinx project>. We support this natively on Read the Docs, and you can do it locally:

<$ pip install recommonmark>

Then in your conf.py:

from recommonmark.parser import CommonMarkParser

source_parsers = {
    '.md': CommonMarkParser,
}

source_suffix = ['.rst', '.md']

Note

Markdown doesn't support a lot of the features of Sphinx, like inline markup and directives. However, it works for basic prose content. reStructuredText is the preferred format for technical documentation, please read this blog post for motivation.
